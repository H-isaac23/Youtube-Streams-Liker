# Youtube-video-liker

This is a project using python which looks through a file with channel IDs and checks whether a stream is on or not. If there is a stream, the script will like the video with the email and password in the environment variables.

## Libraries Used

-Selenium, requests, os, random, time

## Contribution

Any ideas related to a youtube video will be entertained and implemented in the code if decided. For the code, I will be doing it myself but others can suggest ideas as to how to do it.
